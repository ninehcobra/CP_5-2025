# 🚀 Personal Dev Lab

Welcome to my digital playground — a space where I break things, fix them, and (hopefully) learn something in the process. This repo is a living archive of code experiments, deep dives, and notes from my journey as a developer.

---

## ✨ Why this repo?

- To document and reinforce what I learn through real code.
- To experiment freely without worrying about "shipping".
- To keep a personal record of growth over time.

---

## 🛠️ Topics I Might Explore

- ✅ Next.js & React fundamentals
- ✅ Turbopack experiments
- ✅ TypeScript best practices
- ⏳ Testing strategies
- ⏳ Design systems
- ⏳ Fullstack ideas (API, DB, Auth)

## 🧠 Guiding Principles

> 📌 **"Learn by doing. Refactor by understanding. Share to grow."**

- Code > Theory
- Clarity > Cleverness
- Progress > Perfection

## 💡 Notes

This repo is not meant to be a polished product. You may find:

- Unfinished features
- Refactor-in-progress code
- TODO comments everywhere
- Experimental patterns

And that’s the point.
